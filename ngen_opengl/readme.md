ngen_opengl
===========
This library contains the core wrappers around OpenGL, it is intended to be a low-level library with as little
dependency on the rest of ngen as possible. This is so it may be re-used in the future regardless of the engine
it is attached to. Thus you will not find scene management or mesh representations in here.
